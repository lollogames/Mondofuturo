The Great Smog of London was a severe air pollution event that occurred in December 1952, when a combination of cold weather, windless conditions, and heavy coal combustion created a thick layer of smog that covered the city for five days. This catastrophic event resulted in thousands of deaths and severe respiratory illnesses. The primary causes included industrial emissions, widespread domestic use of coal, and weather conditions that trapped pollutants close to the ground. Visibility was reduced to a few meters, paralyzing transportation and daily life. In response, the British government enacted the Clean Air Act of 1956, marking a turning point in environmental legislation. Reflecting on this event helps communities today, including those in the Monti Lepini, to understand the importance of maintaining clean air and investing in sustainable energy solutions. Educational campaigns, improved air quality monitoring, and eco-friendly practices are essential steps to prevent similar health and environmental crises.
