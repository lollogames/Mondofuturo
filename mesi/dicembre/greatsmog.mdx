description: "The "Great Smog" of London was a catastrophic event that hit the British capital from December 5 to 9, 1952. A combination of adverse weather conditions and industrial pollution led to the formation of a dense layer of smog that engulfed the city.

Main Causes:

-Weather conditions: A period of intense cold and the lack of wind prevented the dispersion of fumes, trapping the pollution near the ground.

-Industrial and domestic pollution: The massive use of coal for heating and emissions from industries contributed to the high level of air pollution.

Consequences:

-Public health: it is believed that between 4,000 and 12,000 people died due to exposure to the smog, with an additional 100,000 suffering from severe respiratory illnesses.

-Daily life disruptions: Visibility was reduced to just a few meters, paralyzing public transport and causing the cancellation of public events.

Long-term Results:

-Environmental legislation: The event led to the introduction of the Clean Air Act in 1956, which imposed restrictions on the use of coal and promoted the adoption of cleaner fuels."
